  <h2>Welcome to Dahir Family Childcare</h2>

  <p>
    Dahir Family Childcare began with a simple intention: to create a warm, nurturing, and safe space where children feel
    truly at home. We believe every child deserves individual attention, gentle guidance, and opportunities to grow at
    their own pace.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also understand the challenges families face—especially parents who work unconventional or extended hours. Many
    parents struggle to find reliable nighttime or early-morning care, which is why we chose to offer flexible and
    dependable support around the clock.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, our childcare home has grown into a place filled with curiosity, creativity, and joyful learning. We
    designed our environment intentionally: small, safe, structured, and welcoming. Each day is centered around building
    confidence, encouraging exploration, and helping children feel seen and supported.
  </p>

  <p>
    We proudly offer <strong>24/7 child care</strong> for families with rotating shifts, late-night jobs, early-morning
    responsibilities, or irregular schedules. Whether your child needs daytime, evening, or overnight care, we are here
    to provide stability and comfort.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our mission going forward is to continue being a reliable, trusted, and loving environment where children grow
    emotionally, socially, and intellectually—while supporting parents with the flexibility they deserve.
